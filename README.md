This website was created to show current statistics of COVID-19. It uses an api to show most recent statistics and uses a date calculator to show the time duration since important events. At the bottom of the page is a newsletter sign up form. The form will save a file to your computer with the data entered and will post the data to a google forms spreadsheet.
