      <h2 class="header-description">
        On March 11,2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a
        global pandeimic, its first such designation since declaring H1N1
        influenza a pandemic in 2009.

      <h2 class="title">What is COVID-19?</h2>
      <p>
        Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a
        newly discovered coronavirus. <br />Most people infected with the
        COVID-19 virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and
        recover without requiring special treatment. Older people, and those
        with underlying medical problems like cardiovascular disease, diabetes,
        chronic respiratory disease, and cancer are more likely to develop
        serious illness. <br />The best way to prevent and slow down
        transmission is to be well informed about the COVID-19 virus, the
        disease it causes and how it spreads. Protect yourself and others from
        infection by washing your hands or using an alcohol based rub frequently
        and not touching your face. <br />The COVID-19 virus spreads primarily
        through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose when an infected
        person coughs or sneezes, so itâ€™s important that you also practice
        respiratory etiquette (for example, by coughing into a flexed elbow).
